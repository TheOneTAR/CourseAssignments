# Forum
_An assignment to conclude our Javascript instruction._

The assignment is to create a very basic forum, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with a Google Spreadsheet as a database. Users will fill out a simple form to submit their posts to the forum, which will load all of the posts stored in the 'database'.
