# Zombie Dice
_Eat brains, don't get shotgun'd!_

Students will work in pairs to implement a Python-based implementation of the game Zombie Dice through the Python console.

### Requirements
- UML notation of the classes and objects in the program must be provided.
- Zombie Dice game must be playable with 1-4 players, maintaining the scores of each player, as well as whose turn it is.
- At the start of the program, the user is prompted for number of players, and then the name(s) of the player(s).
- On a player's turn, they should be prompted by the UI using the name they entered that it is their turn.
- Users should be able to exit the game at any time.

### User Interface
- Players should always be presented with the option to roll, end their turn, or exit the game on their turns.
- A player should be able to easily see how many brains and shotguns they have gotten on their current turn, as well as how many dice are left in the 'cup'.
- The UI should always present the scores of all players playing.
- Use Ascii characters to represent the dice. Use a B for brains, S for shotgun, and F for footprints, like so:
[ B ] [ S ] [ F ]

### Extra Info
The dice have different variations of Brains, Shotguns, and Footprints. The breakdown of the dice quantities and their sides:
- Green (6) 3 Brains, 2 Footprints, 1 Shotgun
- Yellow (4) 2 Brains, 2 Footprints, 2 Shotguns
- Red (3) 1 Brain, 2 Footprints, 3 Shotguns
