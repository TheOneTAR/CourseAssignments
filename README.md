# PDXCodeGuild's Assignment Grading Rubric

Each assignment is worth a percentage of your final grade in the course. The exact value of that percentage depends on the difficulty, scale, and overall complexity of the assignment. Your final evaluation score at PDXCodeGuild is based on your assignment performance, Capstone project, and peer reviews.

The following items are evaluated for all assignments submitted for grading to PDXCodeGuild on a Pass, Fail, or Pass with Distinction basis.
